# PyCut
A simple tool to automate screen clipping

How to use:
1. Open snipping tool and take a sample snip, save the file in the directory where you would like all the next snips to go.

2. Run "main.py", it will ask for the prefix of the file, this can be anything. It will then ask for the number to start counting from, this can be any integer.

3. Wait for snipping tool to launch and take your snip, wait for it be saved and then scroll to the next page and snip.

4. When done terminate the program.
